TopoID is a Mathematica package capable of [Topo]logy [ID]entification
and related tasks appearing in multiloop calculations.

Starting from Feynman diagrams, the underlying generic topologies are
identified and their set is minimized.  These generic topologies can
then be decomposed into (linearly independent) Laporta topologies.  FORM
code can be generated in order to map diagrams onto generic topologies
and to process both types of topologies.  Afterwards emerging sets of
master integrals can also be minimized, including generic base changes.

Authors
=======

The first version of TopoID is due to Alexey Pak.  To be more specific
the code for two main algorithms (canonical ordering of polynomials for
topology identification and usage of Groebner bases for partial
fractioning) described in [Pak:2011xt] was adopted initially.  This code
was later rewritten completely and integrated into a new package by Jens
Hoff.  Since then the package gained a lot of functionality, see the
documentation for further information.
