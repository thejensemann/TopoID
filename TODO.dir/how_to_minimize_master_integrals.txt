How to minimize a set of master integrals:
==========================================

- Input:

  * expression involving integrals -> use cancellation
  or
  * list of integrals

  * ".map" files with the topology definitions

  * access to reduction tables of topologies

 [
  * previous set of relations:
      especially integral representations

 ]

- Output:

  * expression
  or
  * new list of integrals

  * rules for non-minimal integrals

  * auxiliary relations
